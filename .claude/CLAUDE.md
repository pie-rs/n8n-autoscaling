* Follow KISS, DRY and ACID principles
* The code should work on any *nix platform and autodetect processor type
* System should autodetect docker or podman (but also have the ability for user to dictate in .env variable)
* any defaults should be in the .env.example file, not code
* always confirm i am happy with all changes then always update project documentation & architecture in ./docs, ./CLAUDE.md and ./readme.md before committing changes and then moving to next task.
