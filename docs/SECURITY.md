## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**: Zero open ports, automatic DDoS protection
- **Strong Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure passwords with salt
- **Network Isolation**: PostgreSQL defaults to localhost-only binding
- **Secure Defaults**: HTTPS cookies enabled, secure configuration templates
- **Input Validation**: Default password rejection, environment variable sanitization

## Known Security Considerations

### Container Runtime Security (High Impact)

**Issue**: The autoscaler requires container runtime socket access to manage containers.
**Impact**: Socket access security varies significantly by runtime mode:

#### Security Ranking (Best to Worst)

1. **ðŸŸ¢ Rootless Podman** - Containers run as regular user, no root access
2. **ðŸŸ¡ Rootless Docker** - User namespaces provide good isolation
3. **ðŸ”´ Rootful Podman** - Limited root access, better than Docker
4. **ðŸ”´ Rootful Docker** - Full root access equivalent

#### Rootless vs Rootful Differences

**Rootless Mode (Recommended)**:

- Containers run as your user account, not root
- No access to privileged ports (< 1024)
- Cannot modify host system files outside user space
- Limited kernel access and system call restrictions
- Significantly reduced attack surface

**Rootful Mode (Security Risk)**:

- Containers can gain root access to host system
- Full access to host filesystem and devices
- Can modify system configuration
- Docker socket access = root access equivalent
- High privilege escalation risk

#### Migration Recommendations

- **Immediate**: Migrate from rootful Docker to rootless Podman
- **Good**: Migrate from rootful Docker to rootless Docker  
- **Acceptable**: Migrate from rootful Podman to rootless Podman
- **Last Resort**: Continue with rootful mode on isolated/trusted networks only

### Secrets Management

**Current**: Environment variables in Docker Compose
**Security Level**: Medium (visible in process lists)
**Recommended**: Use Docker secrets or external secret management for production

### Backup Security

**Current**: AES-256-CBC encrypted backups with 7-day retention
**Security Level**: High (enterprise-grade encryption using N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
**Key Management**: Same encryption key used for n8n and backup encryption

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Contact the maintainers privately at [security contact]
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as needed and will be clearly marked in the changelog. Subscribe to repository notifications to stay informed about security updates.

## Compliance Notes

- **GDPR/CCPA**: Enable backup encryption for personal data processing
- **SOC 2**: Implement additional logging and access controls as needed
- **PCI DSS**: Not recommended for payment processing without additional hardening
- **HIPAA**: Additional encryption and audit controls required for healthcare data

## Security Hardening Recommendations

### For Production Deployments

1. **Network Security**
   - Use Cloudflare tunnels (recommended)
   - Configure firewall rules if using direct exposure
   - Enable Tailscale for team access

2. **Access Control**
   - Use strong, unique passwords (enforced by setup script)
   - Enable n8n user management
   - Regularly review access permissions

3. **Data Protection**
   - Enable backup encryption
   - Use HTTPS only (default with Cloudflare tunnels)
   - Protect log files from unauthorized access

4. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor container resource usage
   - Set up alerting for unusual activity
   - Regularly review access logs

### Docker Security Best Practices

- Use specific image tags instead of `latest`
- Regularly update base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use non-root users where possible (implemented for n8n containers)
